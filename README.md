# Selfie_a_Day_AutoAlign
Batch image file prep and facial alignment written in Python & using OpenCV for 'Selfie a Day' projects.

This is a placeholder Repo at the moment as the project isn't quite ready to be uploaded!

File prep includes:
- renaming files based on date taken exif data, eliminating the problems from using standard 'Date Created'.
- numbers filenames to keep the order & includes the date in the filename for easy reference.
- basic colour grading/normalisation/balance to reduce the varying conditions of all of the photos. 
TBC....

OpenCV is used to detect eyes and then scale and align the image to the same coordinates.

I may try and get it to create the actual timelapse video too.
